# JumBot-Discord
JumBot is a Discord music bot built using discord.py with fully-functioning commands: play, pause, queue, remove, resume, skip, and stop.

Songs will automatically be queued if another song is playing, and the next song in queue will be automatically played. Playing songs can be done using keywords, and the bot will display the information of currently played song, including title, uploader, duration, and the username who invoked the play command.
